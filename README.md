📊 Student Performance Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student performance data by integrating marks and attendance records. It includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to gain insights into academic progress and identify performance patterns.

⚙️ Features
Load and merge data from Excel sheets (Marks & Attendance)
Handle missing values and clean inconsistent data
Transform attendance values (Yes/No → 1/0)
Calculate Total and Percentage scores for each student
Identify performance trends and correlations
Generate insights for better academic evaluation

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas (data cleaning & manipulation)
NumPy (numerical operations)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (data visualization)

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes:
Marks Sheet: Mini Tests, Live Test, Assignment scores
Attendance Sheet: Attendance records (Y/N)

🚀 How to Run
1.Clone this repositorygit clone https://github.com/Kirtiverma64/Student-Performance-Analysis.git
cd Student-Performance-Analysis

2.Install required libraries
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

3.Open the Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook Student_Analysis.ipynb

4.Run all cells to see the analysis results.

📊 Sample Insights
Students with higher attendance tend to perform better.
Percentage scores highlight students needing improvement.
Visualizations reveal trends in marks distribution and attendance impact.

✨ Future Improvements
Add predictive models (e.g., predicting final performance based on attendance & tests)
Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit / Power BI
Automate report generation
